In order to be able to secure web applications, an understanding of how web applications work, their architecture and vulnerabilites is important to be able to secure them effectively. In this post, I will demonstrate how I went about the labs in this module of HTB Academy.</p>

## Front End Components

### HTML

> **Q: What is the HTML tag used to show an image?** `<img>`

### Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

> **Q: What is the CSS "property: value" used to make an HTML element's text aligned to the left?** `text-align: left;`

## Front End Vulnerabilities

### Sensitive Data Exposure

> **Q: Check the above login form for exposed passwords. Submit the password as the answer.**
HiddenInPlainSight

I started by copy pasting the spawn machineâ€™s ip address to the webpage search bar. A login page will appeared.

To have access to the source code of the form, I clicked **view page source** and it will display as shown below:

![Alt Text](/assets/img/WFP2.JPG)

When I scrolled a bit further down, I noticed some commented code that exposed credentials that could be used to login where the username is **admin** and the password **HiddenInPlainSight**. When I tried to loginn with the exposed test credentials, nothing occured:

### HTML Injection

HTML Injection happens when you input data into the input fields of a particular website and its displayed back to you on the page.

> **Q:What text would be displayed on the page if we use the following payload as our input: <a href="https://www.hackthebox.com">Click Me</a>** Your name is Click Me

I entered the provided ip address in the search bar. A web page displayed a button which when clicked displays a modal containing a name input field as shown below:

![Alt Text](/assets/img/HTMLi.JPG)

Payload is harmful code intended to harm the target machine or network. Copy paste the payload into the name input field.

![Alt Text](/assets/img/payload.JPG)

The payload in this particular context is just an anchor element containing a link to hack the box official website. Ater submitting the input the page displayed "Click me" which was the clickable link to the webiste.

![Alt Text](/assets/img/click.JPG)

Upon cliking the link, I was directed to https://www.hackthebox.com

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

> **Q: Try to use XSS to get the cookie value in the above page**
XSSisFun

I injected the following DOM XSS JavaScript code as a payload, which showed the cookie value for the current user:

`#"><img src=/ onerror=alert(document.cookie)>`

An alert window poped up with the cookie value in it:

## Back End Components

### Back End Servers

> **Q: What operating system is 'WAMP' used with?**
Windows

WAMP is a type of combination for back end servers. It consists of Windows, Apache, MySQL, and PHP.

### Web Servers

> **Q: If a web server returns an HTTP code 201, what does it stand for?** created
<p style="text-align: justify;">
HTTP codes are number responses from the web server and each number combination means something. 201 meaning created, 404 meaning not found and so on.</p>

### Databases

> **Q: What type of database is Google's Firebase Database?** NoSQL
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Databases store web application information. NoSQL falls under the category on non-relational databses meaning that it lacks the structure of tables consisting of rows and columns.</p>

### Development Frameworks & APIs

> **Q: Use GET request '/index.php?id=0' to search for the name of the user with id number 1?** superadmin

I copy pasted the get request to the end of the url containing the machine's IP address. At first an error appeared stating that the user with id 0 didn't exist.

![Alt Text](/assets/img/get.JPG)

I changed the id to 1 as directed by the question. The page displayed the user **superadmin**.

## Back End Vulnerabilities

### Common Web Vulnerabilities

> __Q: To which of the above categories does public vulnerability 'CVE-2014-6271' belongs to?__ Command Injection
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) database by MITRE corporation https://cve.mitre.org/, contains information about hardware and software vulnerabilities and each vulnerability has a unique identifier. To figure our the category of the given vulnerability, I searched for it in the CVE database. </p>

### Public Vulnerabilities 
> __Q:  What is the CVSS score of the public vulnerability CVE-2017-0144?__ 9.3
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System), is an open-source industry standard for assessing the severity of security vulnerabilities. Use version 2 https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v2-calculator to calculate the level of severity of CVE-2017-0144. </p>

![Alt Text](/assets/img/cvss.JPG)

I entered the CVE id for the vulnerability to be measured and search:

![Alt Text](/assets/img/cvss2.JPG)

The results indicated 9.3 which was high:

That concludes the Linux fundamentals module on HTB, onto the next! &#x1F60A;
