# 2024 API Exploitation - The wrong implementation you should know
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
On February 24th, I had the privilege of attending the Africa Hackon Masterclass Q1 edition. This session, facilitated by the knowledgeable instructor, Micheal Chesang, is just one of the many great sessions that we had and I specifically chose this Room because I was curious and was excited to learn how to exploit API vulnerabilties, what the contibuting factors could be and how to mitigate them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
The pre-requisite for this masterclass was that you had Burpsuite, Postman and Docker installed. vAPI github respository copied to your local machine and Foxy Proxy extension installed on your firefox extension. A detailed document was provided that guided us on how to have all of the tools downloaded and setup prior to the masterclass.Postman was used to send requests, Burp suite was used to view the requests and launch attacks, vAPI is a Vulnerable Adversely Programmed Interface, which is a Self-Hostable PHP Interface that mimics OWASP API Top 10 scenarios in terms of exercises. The content and exercises in this masterclass were based on materials provided by the instructor, ensuring a comprehensive learning experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
I observed and attempted to do the lab during the masterclass and later successfully managed to complete the lab after attempting a few more times. In this report, I aim to provide a detailed account of my journey towards successfully completing the lab. I will delve into the steps I undertook, the challenges I faced along the way, and the creative solutions I employed to overcome them. By sharing my experiences, I hope to showcase the process of learning and problem-solving that ultimately led to my achievement.</p>

## API1- Broken Object Level Authorization
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
A user can have access to another user's records by manipulating the object identifiers. I used postman to create a new user by navigating to `API 1 >Create User> Body` then I added the user's attributes and sent the request.</p>

![Alt Text](/assets/img/A1.JPG)
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
One challenge that I expereinced in this section was that I had to specify the host in the POST request. That was a temporary solution that I had come up with at that time because for some odd reason postman wasn't picking the proxy server that I had put during the setup.</p>

After creating a new user and sending the request, the user's details were displayed in the body.

![Alt Text](/assets/img/A1two.JPG)
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
In Burpsuite under `Proxy > HTTP History`, the posted request was visible. The Object reference for the user that was created was the ID.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
The new user is what was used to retreive information belonging to other users. Information was retreived using the GET request in postman. All that I needed to do was to edit the ID in the request and the user's details for that particular ID owuld be displayed. I had the challenge of getting the data to be retrieved due to server error 400 but the image below displays my attempt to retreive user one's data.</p>

The expected result was that the details belong to user 1 would be displayed. This is how the first flag was obtained.

## API2 - Broken Authentication
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
Weak or non-existent authentication in API endpoints. Several emails and passwords in a worldist were used to attack the target to get a valid user.</p>

How I got to the folder containing the credentials file (i.e., creds.csv) that had a list of credentials for many users.

```bash
#got to vapi folder
cd vapi
#got to Resources folder
cd Resources
#got to API2_CredentialStuffing directory which had the creds.csv file
cd API2_CredentialStuffing
```
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
Creds.csv is a file that contained each user’s email and password combined and these needed to be separated such that there was a file containing emails only and another containing passwords only to make it easier to load the list of emails and passwords separately into the payload to be used for the brute force attack.</p>

![Alt Text](/assets/img/A2.JPG)

This command was used to separate the data into one file for emails and another for passwords:

```bash
awk -F ',' '{print $ 1}' creds.csv > emails.txt && awk -F ',' '{print $ 2}' creds.csv > pass.txt
```

I had to double check that each file had emails and passwords respectfully.

```bash
#viewed the contents of email.txt
less emails.txt

#viewed the contents of pass.txt
less pass.txt
```

The emails were separated and saved to emails.txt

![Alt Text](/assets/img/em.JPG)

The passwords were separated and saved to pass.txt

![Alt Text](/assets/img/ps3.JPG)

<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
In postman I navigated to `API 2 >User Login > Body` and I entered random data for email and password then selected **Send** to send the request.</p>

![Alt Text](/assets/img/Ai2.JPG)
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
After sending the request a new user was created but the success was showing false because the credentials of the new user that was created were not valid.</p>

![Alt Text](/assets/img/cred.JPG)
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
I opened Burpsuite to view the sent request and similar to postman, the credentials of the user I created weren’t valid. Hence I had to exploit the broken authentication vulnerability to get valid credentials.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
I sent the request to intruder using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + i`. An alternative would’ve been to select the hamburger menu icon right next to Request and select **Send to Intruder**</p>

![Alt Text](/assets/img/in.JPG)

The request was sent to intruder to begin the attack process. I then selected the attack type **Pitch fork**

![Alt Text](/assets/img/pitch.JPG)
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
For the request that was sent to intruder, under Payload Positions, I highlighted the email value and clicked add. The same was done for the password value. This was done to add the values as part of the payload for the intruder attack.</p>

![Alt Text](/assets/img/payload4.JPG)
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
Emails.txt and Pass.txt files were moved to /tmp folder so that they could be uploaded as separate payloads. Two payloads were required prior to the attack because credentials consists of two values, email and password.</p>

```bash
mv emails.txt /tmp/
mv pass.txt /tmp/
```

> Before loading each file for each payload I made sure to uncheck payload encoding
> {: .prompt-warning }

![Alt Text](/assets/img/pay.JPG)

I loaded the emails.txt then pass.txt from the tmp file:

![Alt Text](/assets/img/load1.JPG)

![Alt Text](/assets/img/load1p2.JPG)

I loaded the passwords too:

![Alt Text](/assets/img/load2.JPG)

![Alt Text](/assets/img/load2p2.JPG)
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
Manually typing in the emails and passwords from the files would’ve been a lot of work hence the payloads were being automatically used to bruteforce the users credentials until the correct one was found. This is just a snippet of the process once the attack was started:</p>

![Alt Text](/assets/img/aview.JPG)
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
A tip that we were told is that the quickest way to identify a successful or valid payload entry is by observing the status code (200 - success) and the length, which tends to be a unique number compared to the rest.</p>

![Alt Text](/assets/img/pay1.JPG)

> Note: Tokens are used by systems to identify a particular user without using hardcoded emails and passwords.

I managed to find valid credentials. The status code and length had proved it's validity.

![Alt Text](/assets/img/sav.JPG)
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
To login using the valid credentials, I navigated to `Postman> API2> User login` then I addedd the valid credentials and sent the request. It was a success and the token was displayed for that particular user.</p>

![Alt Text](/assets/img/send.JPG)
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
The challenge of retreiving data resurfaced at this point and I had to edit the GET request by adding the proxy server to replace `host` and inserted the authentication token which was obtained from the previous step so that I could retreive the user's data.</p>

After sending the request I could see other user's information and a flag was founf for the user with ID number 2.

![Alt Text](/assets/img/get3.JPG)
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
To prevent Broken authentication, properly define what your authentication requirements are and to tailor those requirements to the use case.</p>

## API4 - Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
A mobile number was added in Mobile login by navigating to `API 4 > Mobile Login > Body` and adding any mobile number and sending the request. When you enter a mobile number when trying to login in this case, a four digit OTP is sent to that particular devices for authentication which is why the output displayed "success" and a message stating that a four digit OTP had been semt to the entered mobile number.</p>

![Alt Text](/assets/img/mob.JPG)
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
Under the HTTP history tab in Burp suite, the posted api4 request was visible and upon clicking on it more information was displayed. </p>

![Alt Text](/assets/img/mob2.JPG)
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
For the mobile login to be successful, a valid OTP neeeded to be found. Next, I navigated to Verify OTP and entered a random 4 digit code and after sending the request the output stated that the OTP was invalid, therefore the login failed.</p>

![Alt Text](/assets/img/mob3.JPG)
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
I viewed the http request from burp suite and sent it to the intruder to begin the intruder attack. I added the OTP value under Payload positions to add it as one of the values for the intruder attack.</p>

![Alt Text](/assets/img/mob4.JPG)
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
There were still more settings that I did which included using a payload set of 1 and I created a new Resource pool where the maximum concurrent requests was set to 100 to make the process much faster. Once that was done I started the attack. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
The valid OTP was found and that was simply done by observing the status codes and length of the payloads. It had a status code of 200 an a different length compared to the rest.</p>

![Alt Text](/assets/img/mob5.JPG)
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
I confirmed the OTP's validity by returning to Postman, entering it, and sending the request. The resulting output indicated successful verification, and the associated key was displayed as well. </p>

![Alt Text](/assets/img/mob6.JPG)
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
When I tried to send a GET request from postman in order to obtain the details of the user who's phone number made use of the valid OTP, it didn't work. That was another challenge that I faced so instead I copy pasted the key into the authorizaion token and sent the request again, then it worked. The output displayed the user's details and the flag.</p>

![Alt Text](/assets/img/mob7.JPG)

## API5 - Broken Function Level Authorization
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
Occurs when users and groups have access to functions they shouldn't due to issues with authorization rules. I created a new user in postman by navigating to `API 5 > Create User > Body`, then I added the user's data and sent the request.</p>

![Alt Text](/assets/img/five.JPG)
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
To get the user's details I sent a GET request from postman. This was meant to display user data without modifying the header by specifying the host and user ID. I had to make specifications because it worked for previous labs as a temporary solution. I guess for this particular part, it wasn't acceptable. </p>

The screenshot below shows my GET request:

![Alt Text](/assets/img/five1.JPG)

The screenshot below shows the instructor's GET request and what was meant to display after sending it:

![Alt Text](/assets/img/five2.JPG)
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
This is what my request looked like when I  was viewing it from burp suite. (At this point i'm just sharing screenshots of what I got as evidence that I tried  &#128514; ) </p>

![Alt Text](/assets/img/five3.JPG)

What is should've looked like; where the user's data was being displayed as a response:

![Alt Text](/assets/img/five4.JPG)

I sent my request to the repeater. The reesponse was meant to display information belonging to user 3.

![Alt Text](/assets/img/five5.JPG)
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
The GET request was changed from `GET /vapi/api5/users HTTP/1.1` to `GET /vapi/api5/users HTTP/1.1` for the response to return information belonging to all users. One of the user's was admin who's address was the flag. </p>

![Alt Text](/assets/img/five6.JPG)

A tip that we were given was that the easiest way to find endpoints is by going through the source code.
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
In conclusion, the masterclass was very informative, and I had fun trying out the labs even days after the class. I encountered some challenges with the GET requests, where I had to modify the requests to retrieve data, and some of them did not work as expected. Nevertheless, I am glad that I managed to complete the labs and gained a good understanding of the concepts. I am also interested in exploring other recommended API labs such as Juice Shop and experimenting with API3 – Excessive Data Exposure, which involves a lengthy setup process and requires integration with Android Studio, Genymotion, and Burp Suite. Overall, it was an enjoyable masterclass, and I look forward to the next Africa Hackon event.</p>
