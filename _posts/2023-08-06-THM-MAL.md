<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
Malware analysis is used to further understand various types of malwares. In this
room I looked into various factors that are taken into consideration when
analyzing malware such as the point of entry that could be through email, USB
device or even when a user mistakenly clicks on malicious links in websites,
Indicators that malware has been executed on a machine such as unusual
behavior of the computer, what the malware does such as encrypting files,
enabling remote access.</p>

## Understanding Malware Campaigns
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
Malware can be classified into Targeted and Mass campaign. Where targeted is
created for a specific purpose for a particular target and where Mass Campaign
aims to affect as mane devices as possible and affect it in any kind of way.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
An example of a targeted malware campaign is when Stuxnet, a targeted attackesque malware targeted Iran and an example of Mass campaign is Wannacry
which is the Ransomware that used the Eternalblue exploit in a "Mass
Campaign" attack.</p>


> **Q: What is the famous example of a targeted attack-esque Malware that targeted Iran?** Stuxnet


> **Q: What is the name of the Ransomware that used the Eternalblue exploit in a "Mass Campaign" attack?** Wannacry


## Identifying if a Malware Attack has Happened
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
During Malware attacks, there are certain procedures that are followed. Delivery,
Execution, Maintaining persistence and Propagation. Delivery is the means in
which the malware will have access to the target machine, whether it’s through a
USB drive that has a virus or sending malicious links through emails. Execution
is when the malware performs its task once it gets to the target system. Whether
it’s encrypting files, preventing certain services from being available and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
Maintaining persistence is about ensuring that the malware continues to affect
the target system.Propagation makes other machines that are within the network
of the attacked machine also get affected by the malware, hence it spreads to affect
other machines. These machines can be used to conduct other attacks, or they
just may be needed to be accessed for other reasons by the attacker.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
After an attack there are two types of signatures that indicate that it took place;
Firstly, is the host-based signature which included this such as installed
applications and encrypted files and secondly, there’s network-based signatures
which include monitoring of activity such as communication across the network.</p>

> **Q: Name the first essential step of a Malware Attack?** Delivery

> **Q: Now name the second essential step of a Malware Attack?** Execution

> **Q: What type of signature is used to classify remnants of infection on a host?** Host-Based Signatures

> **Q: What is the name of the other classification of signature used after a Malware attack?** Network-Based Signatures

## Static Vs. Dynamic Analysis
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
These are two methods that are used to check for what the malware does. Static
analysis involves looking at the code and making use of checksums and signature
analysis to determine what it does. Dynamic analysis involves running the code
and observing what it does,but this can be very risky especially if it’s ransomware
as it can damage the files in the system of the computer that’s being used to check
what it does.</p>

## Connecting to the Windows Analysis Environment (Deploy)
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
If I were using windows, I would follow these steps to connect to the target
using RDP.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
Start by launching RDP by searching for it in Windows search bar, type in the IP
address provided and click connect.</p>

![Alt Text](/assets/img/rdp.JPG)

Enter the credential provided where the username is `Analysis` and password is `Tryhackme123!`

![Alt Text](/assets/img/rdp2.JPG)
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
A window showing the connection progress will appear and once it’s done you
will see the windows login screen automatically load before you can access the
target machine’s windows desktop.</p>

![Alt Text](/assets/img/rdp3.JPG)
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
I on the other hand used the Linux way because after attempting to follow the
process using the virtual machine provided, I got an error.</p>

![Alt Text](/assets/img/rdp4.JPG)

I had to first connect the try hack me VPN using OpenVPN. For Linux I was advised to use Remmina which I found through **Applications>Internet>Remmina**. I typed in the IP address of the target
machine.


![Alt Text](/assets/img/rdp5.JPG)
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Once that was complete the same credentials that were provided by try hack me for
the windows login is what I used for the RDP authentication credentials that
were required. </p>

![Alt Text](/assets/img/rdp6.JPG)

I successfully logged in to the target as shown below.

## Obtaining MD5 Checksums of Provided Files
<p style="text-align: justify;">
To have access to this particular tasks’ files, the first step was to navigate to task 7
by following the path **Desktop>Tasks>Task7** and when you view what’s in the
folder, there’s three applications (aws, NetLogo and vlc).</p>

![Alt Text](/assets/img/rdp8.JPG)
<p style="text-align: justify;">
To find the MD5 checksum values for each, I had to view the properties in the
hashes section. The screenshots below show all of the MD5 checksum values
that I found for each application.</p>

![Alt Text](/assets/img/rdp9.JPG)

![Alt Text](/assets/img/rdp10.JPG)

> **Q: The MD5 Checksum of aws.exe**
> D2778164EF643BA8F44CC202EC7EF157
> {: .prompt-tip }

> **Q: The MD5 Checksum of Netlogo.exe**
> 59CB421172A89E1E16C11A428326952C
> {: .prompt-tip }

> **Q: The MD5 Checksum of vlc.exe**
> 5416BE1B8B04B1681CB39CF0E2CAAD9F
> {: .prompt-tip }

## Now lets see if the MD5 Checksums have been analysed before

I copy pasted the MD5 values to virustotal to find out if the files were malicous or not.

> **Q: Does Virustotal report this MD5 Checksum / file aws.exe as malicious? (Yay/Nay)** Nay

aws MD5: D2778164EF643BA8F44CC202EC7EF157

![Alt Text](/assets/img/vt.JPG)

> **Q: Does Virustotal report this MD5 Checksum / file Netlogo.exe as malicious? (Yay/Nay)** Nay

NetLogo MD5: 59CB421172A89E1E16C11A428326952C

![Alt Text](/assets/img/vt1.JPG)

> **Q: Does Virustotal report this MD5 Checksum / file vlc.exe as malicious? (Yay/Nay)** Nay

VLC MD5: 5416BE1B8B04B1681CB39CF0E2CAAD9F

## Identifying if the Executables are obfuscated / packed

For executable applications, there’s a tool to see what’s used to execute it. In this
task we used PeiD which I accessed through **Desktop>Tools>Static>PE** Tools.

![Alt Text](/assets/img/obf.JPG)

The two files to be tested were in Task 9 folder as shown below.

![Alt Text](/assets/img/obf1.JPG)

> **Q: What does PeID propose 1DE9176AD682FF.dll being packed with?** Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 DLL
<p style="text-align: justify;">
After running PeiD as an administrator the following window pops up. I had to
select the folder that contains the Task 9 files and started with the
1DE9176…FF.dll file. The PeID proposed that 1DE9176AD682FF.dll was being
packed with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 DLL as shown below.</p>

![Alt Text](/assets/img/obf2.JPG)

> **Q: What does PeID propose AD29AA1B.bin being packed with?** Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I followed the same procedure for the AD29AA1B.bin file and the PeID proposed
that AD29AA1B.bin was being packed with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 as shown
below.</p>

## What is Obfuscation / Packing?
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Packing is one form of obfuscation that malware Authors employ to prevent the
analysis of programmes. Malware Authors employ obfuscation techniques such
as packing with the intent to prevent people like us reversing it to understand its
behaviors and ultimately with the aim of achieving infection.</p>

> **Q: What packer does PeID report file "6F431F46547DB2628" to be packed with?** FSG 1.0 -> dulek/xt
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This task was a continuation of the previous one, and I was required to get what
PeID report file "6F431F46547DB2628" from Task 10 folder was said to be packed
with and found it to be FSG 1.0 -> dulek/xt.</p>

![Alt Text](/assets/img/obf4.JPG)

## Visualising the Differences Between Packed & Non-Packed Code
<p style="text-align: justify;">
PeID has a huge database, it doesn't have every packer out there! Especially if an
Author has written their own - PeID will have no way of identifying the packer
used. In cases like this, it's more about what PeID doesn't tell us - rather than
what it does. PeID is able to detect what packer has been used to obfuscate the
code. Whilst PeID is capable of detecting the possibility of packers being used, it
is not able to automatically de-obfuscate them. </p>

I proceeded to use a tool called IDA Freeware that’s located in the
**Tools/Static/Disassembly** directory. It should enable me to see how the code
flows in the 9C..C2 file. I went to the import tab and saw two imports.

![Alt Text](/assets/img/obf6.JPG)

This is the code from the first import that I got to view.

## Introduction to Strings
<p style="text-align: justify;">
"Strings" are essentially the ASCII / Text contents of a program...this could be
anything from passwords for self-extracting zips, to bitcoin addresses in
ransomware samples.</p>

I first navigated to **C:\Users\Analysis\Desktop\Tools\SysinternalSuite** so that I
can make use of Microsoft's Sysinternals "Strings".

![Alt Text](/assets/img/str.JPG)

I used Microsoft's Sysinternals "Strings" program to output the retained strings
within the specified file in "Task 12" using the command strings
**C:\Users\Analysis\Desktop\Tasks\Task 12\67844C01** and a long list of
different string values appeared.

![Alt Text](/assets/img/str1.JPG)
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Some valuable information obtained from the long list of strings displayed was
a URL practicalmalwareanalysis.com which was used to answer the first question
in this task.</p>

![Alt Text](/assets/img/str2.JPG)

A better tool called PE explorer can be used to see the strings outputted instead
of scrolling though many lines of output.

To access the tool, I followed the directory path shown below:

![Alt Text](/assets/img/str3.JPG)

This appeared after running the application. I dragged the file that was used in
the previous task onto the application after this.

![Alt Text](/assets/img/str4.JPG)

After I dragged the file onto the application, this is what I saw. I proceeded by
navigating to **view->imports**.

![Alt Text](/assets/img/str5.JPG)

I saw 5 imports and for each import I could see its RVA, Hint and Name.

![Alt Text](/assets/img/str6.JPG)

> **Q: What is the URL that is outputted after using "strings"** practicalmalwareanalysis.com

> **Q: How many unique "Imports" are there?** 5

## Introduction to Imports
<p style="text-align: justify;">
IDA can be used for both Static and Dynamic analysis. Tools like IDA Freeware
can further be classified into Disassemblers and Debuggers. Disassemblers reverse
the compiled code of a program from machine code to human-readable
instructions (assembly). This is limited to how the program represents itself in its
current state! I.e., If the contents of an executable changes during execution -
"Disassemblers" will not reflect this.Debuggers deploy the same techniques used
by "Disassemblers", "Debuggers" essentially facilitate execution of the program -
where the analyzer can view the changes made throughout each "step" of the
program.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The file that had been selected to disassemble is install.exe that’s in the Task13
folder as shown below.</p>

![Alt Text](/assets/img/imp.JPG)

Next step is to select Portable executable for 80386 (PE)

![Alt Text](/assets/img/imp1.JPG)

A sign that the file was successfully uploaded to IDA is the view shown below.

![Alt Text](/assets/img/imp2.JPG)
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I navigated to the import to view all the imports available. I managed to find
those that make use of the msi library, and they were found to be 9 in total.</p>

## Practical Summary

> **Q: What is the MD5 Checksum of the file?** f5bd8e6dc6782ed4dfa62b8215bdc429

The file that was used for this tasks practical is ComplexCalculator.exe

![Alt Text](/assets/img/prac.JPG)

I checked the properties of the application, particularly in the File hashes section
for its MD5 hash.

![Alt Text](/assets/img/pracm.JPG)

> **Q: Does Virustotal report this file as malicious? (Yay/Nay)** Yay

Two security vendors found the application to be malicious therefore Yay.

![Alt Text](/assets/img/pracm2.JPG)

> **Output the strings using Sysinternals "strings" tool.**

> **Q: What is the last string outputted?** d:h:

After navigating to the C:Users\Analysis\Desktop\Tools\SysinternalsSuite folder
through cmd, I used the `strings “C:Users\Analysis\Desktop\Tasks\Task14\ComplexCalculator.exe”` command to get the strings tied to this application
and found the last one to be d:h:

![Alt Text](/assets/img/pracm3.JPG)

> **Q: What is the output of PeID when trying to detect what packer is used by the file?** Nothing Found

I really looked all over a couldn’t find anything &#x1F602;
