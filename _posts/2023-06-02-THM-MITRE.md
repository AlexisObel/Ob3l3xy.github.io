<p style="text-align: justify;">
MITRE is a nonprofit organization that plays a critical role in advancing cybersecurity and helping organizations improve their security posture.Through its various resources and tools, such as the ATT&CK framework and the CVE database, MITRE provides valuable insights into the latest threats and vulnerabilities and offers guidance on how to mitigate these risks.</p>

This learning path focused on projects created by MITRE:

- **ATT&CK®** (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) Framework
- **CAR** (Cyber Analytics Repository) Knowledge Base
- **ENGAGE** (sorry, not a fancy acronym)
- **D3FEND** (Detection, Denial, and Disruption Framework Empowering Network Defense)
- **AEP** (ATT&CK Emulation Plans)

## ATT&CK® Framework

According to the website, MITRE ATT&CK® is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.

> **Q: Besides Blue teamers, who else will use the ATT&CK Matrix? (Red Teamers, Purple Teamers, SOC Managers?)** Red Teamers

Purple teamers play the role of both red and blue teamers and SOC managers fall under the blue team as they focus mostly on defensive security.

> **Q: What is the ID for this technique?** T1566

The instruction suggested that all the answers could be obtained from the phishing page, hence the first thing that I observed upon vieiwing the page was the ID for the phishing technique.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To get the data sources listed for detection, i scrolled further down to the detection section and listed them in the required format in the order that they appeared.</p>

> **Q: What groups have used spear-phishing in their campaigns? (format: group1,group2)** Axiom,Gold SOUTHFIELD

I scrolled to the procedure examples section to obtain the groups that used spear-phishing in their campaigns.

![Alt Text](/assets/img/proex.JPG)

> **Q: Based on the information for the first group, what are their associated groups?** Group 72

To get the associated group for Axiom which is the first group, I clicked on it's group ID `G0001` and found Group 72

![Alt Text](/assets/img/G72.JPG)

> **Q: What software is associated with this group that lists phishing as a technique?** Hikit

To get the softwrae I scrolled to the sofwatre section still within the same oage where the associated geoup was found and skimmed through the techniques listed for each and `Hikit` had listed phishing as one of them.

![Alt Text](/assets/img/hikit.JPG)

> **Q: What is the description for this software?** Hikit is malware that has been used by Axiom for late-stage persistence and exfiltration after the initial compromise.

For this question, I just clicked on Hikit then got directed to it's web page and copy pasted it's description.

![Alt Text](/assets/img/dhikit.JPG)

> **Q: This group overlaps (slightly) with which other group?** Winnti Group

Winnti has been mentioned as one of the other groups that slightly overlaps with Axiom as it was shown under Axiom's description.

> **Q: How many techniques are attributed to this group?** 15

## CAR Knowledge Base
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The official definition of CAR is "The MITRE Cyber Analytics Repository (CAR) is a knowledge base of analytics developed by MITRE based on the MITRE ATT&CK® adversary model. CAR defines a data model that is leveraged in its pseudocode representations but also includes implementations directly targeted at specific tools (e.g., Splunk, EQL) in its analytics. With respect to coverage, CAR is focused on providing a set of validated and well-explained analytics, in particular with regards to their operating theory and rationale."</p>

> **Q: What tactic has an ID of TA0003?** Persistence

Link provided for this question: https://car.mitre.org/analytics/CAR-2020-09-001/
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The scheduled Task/Job technique contained Execution, Persistence and Privilege Escalation as the tactics used to acheieve it. I clicked on each tactic to view their ID's and found Persistence with the ID of TA0003.</p>

![Alt Text](/assets/img/ta0003.JPG)

> **Q: What is the name of the library that is a collection of Zeek (BRO) scripts?** BZAR

I navigated to the main page, scrolled down to Analytic Source Code libraries and found Zeek (BRO) scripts mentioned as part of the BZAR library collection.

![Alt Text](/assets/img/zeek.JPG)

> **Q: What is the name of the technique for running executables with the same hash and different names?** Masquerading

I simply searched within the full analytic list.

![Alt Text](/assets/img/shash.JPG)

> **Q: Examine CAR-2013-05-004, besides Implementations, what additional information is provided to analysts to ensure coverage for this technique?** Unit Tests

The starting point was the bottom of the oage where I found CAR-2013-05-004. After clicking on it I found the additional information required for it.

## MITRE Engage

Per the website, "MITRE Engage is a framework for planning and discussing adversary engagement operations that empowers you to engage your adversaries and achieve your cybersecurity goals."

> **Q: Under Prepare, what is ID SAC0002?** Persona Creation

After I visited the Mitre engage website https://engage.mitre.org/ , I scrolled down to **Explore the Matrix** which directed me to the Matrix tools page, then selected Persona creation which was listed under the **Prepare** category. This exposed the Persona Creation ID.

![Alt Text](/assets/img/personac.JPG)

> **Q: What is the name of the resource to aid you with the engagement activity from the previous question?** Persona Profile Worksheet

I navigated to the tools page and found Persona Profile Worksheet listed, as directed by the hint that was provided below.

> Hint: Check Tools > All Tools
> {: .prompt-tip }

![Alt Text](/assets/img/ppw.JPG)

> **Q: Which engagement activity baits a specific response from the adversary?** Lures

The **Operate** section and Lures had been listed as an activity used to detect under exposure, disrupt upder affect and direct.
