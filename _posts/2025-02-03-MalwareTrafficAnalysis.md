<p style="text-align: justify;">
Malware activity can be detected from the processes that it executes on the computers. More information on the malware activity can be found through static and dynamic analysis on it. Network traffic can also provide more information about malware. Analyzing malware traffic is important because it helps you understand what malware is capable of, and with that knowledge, you can properly safeguard your network and systems. In the event of an incident, appropriate measures can be put in place to respond to malware-related incidents.
The exercise was from malware-traffic-analysis.net, and I started with the most recent exercise "Download from fake software site".
