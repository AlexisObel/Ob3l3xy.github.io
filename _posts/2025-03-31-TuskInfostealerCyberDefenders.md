A blockchain development company detected unusual activity when an employee was redirected to an unfamiliar website while accessing a DAO management platform. Soon after, multiple cryptocurrency wallets linked to the organization were drained. Investigators suspect a malicious tool was used to steal credentials and exfiltrate funds.

Your task is to analyze the provided intelligence to uncover the attack methods, identify indicators of compromise, and track the threat actorâ€™s infrastructure.
